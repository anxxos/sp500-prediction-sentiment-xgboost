### Abstract
Successful investment strategies need to be ahead of stock market movements. Machine learning paves the way for the development of financial theories that can forecast those movements. In this work an application of the Triple-Barrier Method and Meta-Labeling techniques is explored with XGBoost for the creation of a sentiment-based trading signal on the S&P 500 stock market index. The results confirm that sentiment data have predictive power, but a lot of work is to be carried out prior to implementing a strategy.

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook with all the code used to generate insights.
